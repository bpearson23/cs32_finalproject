When distilling resumed in 1974, Caol Ila was the largest producer of single malt on the Isle of Islay.

This 15year old was introduced by Bulloch Lade, and bottled into the 1980s. When DCL were succeeded by United Distillers, one of the new company's first orders of business was to regain control of the distribution of these single malts, taking the licenses back from the blending houses.

Despite its traditional appearance, Laphroaig was always a forward-thinking distillery. It was bottled as a single malt as early as the 1920s, an unfashionable option at the time, especially for a peated whisky. They were also shrewd in capitalising on post-Prohibition America to add trademark sweetness to their spirit through the use of imported ex-bourbon casks, and hired Scotland’s first ever female distillery manager, Bessie Williamson, in 1954. Laphroaig is one of only a handful of distilleries in Scotland to still use in-house maltings, providing them with 20% of their annual requirements, and contributing to the distillery’s unique flavour profile.This is an older bottling of Laphroaig 10 year old from the later 1970s.ABonfanti import for the Italian market,these releases are renowned for their quality and flavour, regarded as some of the finest Laphroaig ever bottled."

For most of the 20th century it was self-sufficient, malting its own barley using peat from Pitsligo, giving it a unique smoky character. In fact, in 1968 it was short-listed by then-owners DCL, to convert to heavily peated production in order to make up for a shortfall on Islay caused by a drought. In an odd twist of fate, the decision was instead made to re-open Brora for the job, and close Glen Garioch down. Morrison Bowmore then sprang to its rescue, restarting production in 1973. The maltings and distillery were shut down again by Beam Suntory in 1995, and only the latter resumed operations two years later, with contemporary Glen Garioch becoming an un-peated single malt. These pre-1995 vintages are worth investigating while you can."

The distillery was an early advocate of its single malt, which it sold under the brand name, Strathisla, after the river that runs past the site. Strathisla single malt was bottled as early as the late 19th century, and proved very popular. None-the-less, by the 1940s it was struggling, needing rescued by Canadian giants, Seagram, who bought it in 1950, renaming it Strathisla the following year, and tasking it as a key contributor to its Chivas blends. Despite this, the single malt brand remained a core part of the business, and remains so to this day.Seagram licensed the distillery’s single malt brand to their Chivas Brothers blending operation, but also to Gordon & MacPhail in the 1960 and 1970s. It is the latter’s bottles that are far more prominent. This good standing with the distillery has furnished the Elgin-based independent firm with a steady supply of high-quality casks, and subsequently, high-quality releases.Chivas Brothers became to sole licensee in the 1980s, launching a 12 year old using this classic branding. Gordon & MacPhail continued to buy and bottle casks, developing a new “house label” which they used until the 1990s when Strathisla was given a modern new look as part of the Seagram Heritage Selection. Rather than confine it to history, Gordon & MacPhail reverted to using this classic label, and continue to do so today. As of 2018, bottles in this style have been branded as part of the Distillery Labels range.This release was distilled on 5th April 1967 and bottled from single cask #2063 on 16th June 2003. One of 153 bottles produced to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Bar Metro.Founded by Georgio d'Ambrosio, Bar Metro in Milan was a favourite of connoisseurs in its time for its incredible selection. Giorgio was a contemporary of the legendary Edoardo Giaconne of the Edward & Edward 'whiskyteca' in Salo, and both men were among the first in Italy to have special bottlings produced for their bars."

Prized by blenders, the distillery found itself in the hands of DCL in 1925 when they acquired shareholders, Ainslie & Heilbron and John Walker & Sons. The distillery remains an important part of Diageo blends to this day, however nowadays it is produced at a new Clynelish, opened by DCL in 1967. The original distillery was briefly run in tandem with new one, known as Clynelish B (and the new one Clynelish A), until being closed down in early 1968. Although operating under the same name, the original Clynelish has a distinct profile, particularly prior to its modernisation in the 1960s. Its single malt is increasingly revered, not least due to its re-opening in 1969 as Brora distillery. Having closed again in 1983, the distillery became legendary in the years that followed, with both original Clynelish and Brora becoming huge collector's items. In 2017 it was announced that Diageo planned to re-open this formerly lost gem.As was often the case with the distilleries in the DCL portfolio, Clynelish was licensed to one of the blending companies within its portfolio. In this case it was Ainslie & Heilbron, a constituent of whom, James Ainslie & Co, had owned the distillery until 1912. When DCL were succeeded by United Distillers, one of the new company's first orders of business was to regain control of the distribution of its single malts, taking the licenses back from the blending houses. Clynelish single malt was not bottled again until 1991 when it became part of the Flora & Fauna range, and it would not be until 2002 that it was bottled with its own unique brand again.This rare Ainslie & Heilbron bottling was produced in 1969on behalf of the legendary Italian bar owner, Edoardo Giaccone.Giaccone was something of a trailblazer, and was importing specially bottled official single malts for his bar from the late 1960s, this is one of his earliest. He opened the famous venue in 1958, and it has been called a few different things over the years, including Garten, Edward & Edward (during the period this was imported), and La Taverna del Comandante.Edoardoset the stage for later legendary bottlers such as SilvanoSamaroli, NadiFioriand Ernesto Mainardi. Moon Import founder, PepiMongiardinosaid, ""he was the first person I visited"" when he became the distributor for Bruichladdichin 1981. Giaccone did not have any of his own labels or series, but was the first person in Italy to have official bottlingsproduced exclusivelyfor him. Through his bar, Italy was treated to exclusive releases from Clynelish, Bowmore, Dalmore, Highland Park and even Jack Daniel's.This 12 year old was bottle at a cask strength of 56.9%, at his request. Clynelish bottled three batches of this for Giaccone in 1969, 1971 and 1973."

The blending firm merged with DCL (now Diageo) in 1927, who still run the distillery today. In 1972 the original site was demolished and replaced by a new one. When distilling resumed in 1974, Caol Ila was the largest producer of single malt on the Isle of Islay. Despite this, due to its importance in popular blends such as Johnnie Walker, its single malt brand disappeared under United Distillers, and it was not until 2002 that it would return, when the 12 year old was revived by Diageo. The Flora & Fauna release was well-regarded in the meantime, but it was independent releases like this that gave the best opportunity to sample this much-loved single malt.Samaroli are perhaps Italy's most revered independent bottler of Scotch whisky. With an impeccable taste in single cask whiskies, and an eye for aesthetics (if not English spelling at times!), founder Silvano Samaroli is regarded by many as a visionary. Since his passing in 2017, the company has been run by his friend Antonio Bleve, who continues his tradition of high quality releases. Many of Silvano’s early bottlings occupy deserved spots on the pantheon of all-time whisky greats.Silvano's early bottlings were filled for him Scotland by R.W.

Indeed, owners Pernod-Ricard now put a heavy focus on the brand being ‘The Glenlivet’, encouraging their consumers not to accept any imitations. Glenlivet is in a long-running battle with Glenfiddich for the title of best-selling single malt, with both now selling over a million cases a year. George Smith secured a license to legally distil at Glenlivet in 1824, and it remained family-run until 1978 when Seagram bought a controlling stake in what had by then become The Glenlivet Distilleries Ltd, and counting assets such as Glen Grant, Benriach and Longmorn among its portfolio. When Seagram collapsed in 2001, Pernod-Ricard acquired its sizeable Chivas Brothers Scotch whisky division, with Glenlivet the crown jewel in an empire rivalled only by Diageo."

Glen Grant was bottled as a single malt as early as the late-19th century, and developed a global export market. None perhaps as important as in Italy, where their agent in the 1960s, Armando Giovinetti, turned it into the nation's favourite whisky, after discovering the palate preferences of his countrymen for very young single malts.

The distillery was bought under the control Suntory the year after (they had been stakeholders since 1989), and it remains one of the most collectible brands in Scotch whisky today. Bowmore is one of the few remaining Scottish distilleries to use its own floor maltings, providing them with 40% of their requirements.

He ran the distillery until his retirement in the 1890s, and it was renamed in his honour in 1904. Having survived Prohibition, it was bought up by the Schenley company in 1933, who ran it as part of their extensive portfolio for the next fifty years, eventually selling it to Age International. The latter's new Japanese ownership in 1992 had no interest in it (only in its brands), and immediately sold it to the Sazerac company, who renamed it Buffalo Trace in 1999.Because Sazerac did not own the the existing distillery portfolio, they necessarily had to begin adding new brands to their range. Besides their eponymous flagship bourbon, perhaps the most important of these was this, the George T. Stagg.
