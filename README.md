# cs32_finalproject

I am completing the final project independently.

## Automatic tracking of transaction and pricing updates on auction / social media website:
The code in this project allows for the automatic tracking of updates to a website (to be chosen later) and collation of data related to transactions of particular goods on the website. The ideal output for this project is a script that produces a real-time, updating, dynamic, searchable dataframe summarizing data related to bids, selling prices, timelines, and available goods for transactions taking place on a website. I will choose the particular website that I want to use after I start inspecting html structures and estimate the time required to analyze data from different websites. An example of a website I am considering is a whiskey auction site.

## Motivation:
Connoisseurs of particular goods (especially luxury goods and alcohol) do many transactions through auction websites and social media conversations. There is a huge advantage to possessing the most updated information related to market prices and at what price transactions are usually taking place. The goal of this project is to create a self-updating data structure that keeps track of these changes to reduce the amount of time people have to go through these websites manually. I am motivated to do this project because I am interested in writing a script that has an ongoing connection with a website instead of a one-time connection and using this connection to dynamically update data output.

## Build status: 
I have not written any code for the project yet. The first step will be to decide which website I want to focus on.
