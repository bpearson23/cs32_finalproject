## Automatic tracking of transaction and pricing updates on auction / social media website:

The code in this project allows for the automatic tracking of updates to a website and collation of data related to transactions of particular goods. The ideal output for this project is a script that produces a real-time updating dynamic searchable dataframe summarizing data related to bids, selling prices, timelines, and available goods for transactions taking place on an auction or social media website. I will choose the particular website that I want to use after I start inspecting html structures and estimate the time required to analyze data from different websites. 

## Motivation:
Connoisseurs of particular goods (especially luxury goods and alcohol) do many transactions through auction websites and social media conversations. There is a huge advantage to possessing the most updated information related to market prices and at what price transactions are usually taking place. The goal of this project is to create a self-updating data structure that keeps track of these changes to reduce the amount of time people have to go through these websites manually. 

## Build status: 
I have not written any code for the project yet. The first step will be to decide which type of website I want to focus on.
