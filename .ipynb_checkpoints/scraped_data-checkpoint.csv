Duthie for Samaroli,N/A,57%,75cl,Operational,"Ardbeg 1973Samaroli / Fragments of ScotlandYou would not think it to see it now, but Ardbeg had a difficult time of it for much of the 20th century. The distillery was bought in a joint venture between Hiram Walker and DCL in 1959, both intending to supply their blends. The subsequent years were very successful, but DCL backed out in 1979 (closing many of their other distilleries a few years later), and Hiram Walker then struggled in the 1980s era oversupply when interest is blended Scotch was waning. They closed it down for the majority of the decade. It re-opened briefly in the 1990s before being revived for good by Glenmorangie plc in 1997. The lack of demand in the period prior to this, thankfully, saw a lot of casks sold to independent bottlers, many of which have gone on to become legendary releases.Distilled in 1973 and bottled in 1988 by Silvano Samarolias part of the rare Fragments of Scotland series.The rising demand for its product in the 1970s meant that Ardbeg was forced to stop using its own malted barley, instead buying it in from the neighbouring Port Ellen maltings. The result was a change in the style and profile of the distillery's whisky, and pre-1974 vintages such as this are incredibly sought after by connoisseurs and collectors alike.Samaroli is perhaps Italy's most revered independent bottler of Scotch whisky. With an impeccable taste in single cask whiskies, and an eye for aesthetics (if not English spelling at times!), he is regarded by many as a visionary. Many of his bottles now occupy deserved sports on the pantheon of whisky greats.The Fragments of Scotland series was bottled in 1988, and each of them feature artworks depicting different elements of Scotland, all painted by Samaroli'sfriend, Agostino Perrnini. The painting on this particular label belonged to Silvano, and also appears on the Glen Garioch and Glenugiebottlings.Bottle number 289 of only 648."

Despite its traditional appearance, Laphroaig was always a forward-thinking distillery. It was bottled as a single malt as early as the 1920s, an unfashionable option at the time, especially for a peated whisky. They were also shrewd in capitalising on post-Prohibition America to add trademark sweetness to their spirit through the use of imported ex-bourbon casks, and hired Scotland’s first ever female distillery manager, Bessie Williamson, in 1954. Laphroaig is one of only a handful of distilleries in Scotland to still use in-house maltings, providing them with 20% of their annual requirements, and contributing to the distillery’s unique flavour profile.First launched in 1985, this particular bottling was said to be Prince Charles' favourite. It was replaced in the core range by an 18 year old expression in 2009.This bottle was imported to Italy by F&C."

It was not until the 1980s downturn in the market that the distillery decided to focus on its single malt brand. Fortuitously, this coincided with the crest of a wave of enthusiasm for the high quality releases that the distillery had licensed to Campbell, Hope & King and Gordon & MacPhail in the 1960s and 1970s. These remain some of the most collectible on the market. While global single malt sales volume is still lead by Speyside neighbours, Glenfiddich and Glenlivet, Macallan is easily the most sought after. So much so in fact, that they had to open a brand new distillery in 2018, a subterranean architectural masterpiece within the Easter Elchies estate, boasting 36 copper pot stills.Macallan vintage releases produced by Campbell, Hope & King tended to be aged around the 15 year old mark, but when Macallan took over the responsibility in 1980, they toyed for a few releases with more advanced age-statements of 17 and 18 years old. The latter was deemed the optimum maturation, and the official 18 year old was launched in 1984. It is now an absolute classic of the whisky world.Distilled in 1966, this was was the first in the series proper. These veryearly releases were packaged in the the classic white boxes, predating thosefeaturing the Sara Middawatercolours of Easter Elchieshouse, synonymous with Macallan of the period.Imported to the Italian market by Giovinetti& Figli."

Prized by blenders, the distillery found itself in the hands of DCL in 1925 when they acquired shareholders, Ainslie & Heilbron and John Walker & Sons. DCL closed the distillery in 1967 after opening a new, larger Clynelish next-door, but re-opened the first site, now renamed as Brora the following year. Bottlings of the whisky it produced between then and its second closure in 1983 are now increasingly sought after. It was never bottled officially as Brora during its years of operation, and the Rare Malts Selection in 1995 were the first distillery bottlings to bear the name. In 2017 it was announced that Diageo planned to re-open this formerly lost gem, and the revived distillery filled its first casks on 19thMay 2021.The Rare Malts Selection releases were there followed by an annual distillery bottling as part of the Diageo special releases each year.

They became the first distillery to actively market their single malt brand in 1963, and were the first to open their facility to visitors. Glenfiddich was an important trailblazer in the whisky industry, who's contribution cannot be forgotten. The scale of their operation today is a testament to this.Thisrelease was restricted to only nine casks laid down in the 1930s, one cask for each of William Grant's nine childrenwho helped build Glenfiddich distillery into the success that it has become today.
